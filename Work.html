<p>My work experience started when I was in hospital library where my mother works as part of the Industrial Training</p>
<p>I did some work by rearranging the books</p>
<p>Sometimes, I did some cataloging the books which involves pasting the envelope and lending cards on the back or the front of the book</p>
<p><Overall, I did some contributions to the library since it's newly established facility</p>
<p>That was a good experience</p>
