<p>My hobby is listening to music, drawing and computer surfing.</p>
<p>My favourite music is J-Pop, K-Pop, Mandopop and Cantopop</p>
<p>Drawing is my passion. I have enough skills to draw my characters and even managed to think about the series about them</p>
<p>I love computers since childhood. I'm surfing the Internet most of the time. Sometimes, I would do assignments and Internet surfing after that.</p>
